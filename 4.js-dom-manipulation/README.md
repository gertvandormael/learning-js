## Exercise

We are going to make a functional pokedex! The basic setup you can find in [this](./index.html) HTML file.

1. Read the code and try to understand it. Write comments wherever you feel necessary.
1. Add some `console.log`'s in the code and see what certain variables contain. Play around with it a little bit!
1. Write the code necessary to complete the exercise: 
    * Use the variables provided to show a pokemon's data on the web page!
    * Write your code in the function `DoThingsWithTheDom()`. This function gets executed every single time you try looking for a new pokemon.
    * Use the function `LogPokeData()` to log the data of the pokemon you searched for last!
    * Use the function `LoadPokemonList()` to add a list of all pokemon to your HTML. You can click on any pokemon to search for them!
1. Style your page to make it look a bit more appealing!
